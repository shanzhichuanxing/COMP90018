The motivation of application
In amidst the covid pandemic, it becomes crucial for Victoria's residents to avoid dangerous covid exposure sites. If there was an application to keep track of both the exposure site locations and the locations the user has visited, it would be an effective avoidance and tracking mechanism. The Zones app can mark all levels of exposure sights on the map in the past 14 days from the government site and record the places the user has visited into a database. It is a tracking app designed to keep victorian residents safe in covid.

Use
- The user must first register their email and password and upload them to our database. 
- The application might freeze for and 10s when it first enters the Zone's page due to it
getting marker data from government sites

Zone
- Once the app is entering the zones page, it will ask for location permission which the user must select allow while using
- Once given permission, the app can now track the user location using the google maps API.
- Clicking the hazardous symbol button in the bottom right corner reveals 3 different tiers of the exposure sites ranking (most dangerous -> least dangerous: red -> blue). Clicking on different
tiers reveal the markers for sites of exposure on the map.
- Search bar searches a location on the map.

Past Trace
- Clicking on a calendar will show the trace history for that day in a combination of lines and 
markers.
- The markers will contain the time information of when the user was at the said location


Future Development:

Zone
- We will be adding the function to auto-detect if the user is near any exposure sites, and send a notification to the phone.

Past Trace
- We will be adding more details to the marker detail including the name of the position along with the time.
- We will also be adding the ability to warn users if a new exposure site has been found at a past trace location.
- We will also be adding the ability to identify dates that have a trace and dates that don't.
